Arduino Parallel Eprom Reader

Read a parallel eprom using two Arduinos.

Based on code from arduino forum http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1269280823.

Arduinos communicate with each other using I2C.	

Implemented Arduino I2C communication because I don't have a 
Arduino Mega board, not even a demux :( , and because was fun :).

Master Arduino writes the address in the 16 input ports
and sends a signal to slave Arduino who reads the output 
in the 8 output ports and sends data to computer.
